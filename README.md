# DeepaMehta 5 Detail Panel

## Version History

* Rename component prop `object-renderers` to `detail-renderers`. It contains both, `object` and `value` renderers.

* Info-tab component does not render title. The underlying object renderer has full rendering control.
* New component property `markerIds` allows rendering certain topics as "marked" in the related-tab

**0.13** -- Apr 10, 2018

**0.12** -- Mar 25, 2018

* Improved auto-positioning of new topics
* Improved composability:
    * New `quill-config` property allows parent component to customize the Quill editor in both ways, setting options, and providing extensions (e.g. formats)
    * Emit `submit-inline` event to signalize "inline editing completed" (info-tab)
    * Emit `child-topic-reveal` to signalize "user clicked 'Reveal' button" (info-tab)

* Packaging: `dm5-topic-list` is now a reusable component, a standalone node-module

* Improved composability:
    * Component relies on explicit props (instead of context injection).
